# linked_lists
Odin Project Linked List Ruby Project

## Objective
To learn how to make linked lists using Ruby. This contains a methods for adding, removing, finding values / indexes, and printing linked lists. 

## Code
Most methods use the 

```
current_node = @head
    while current_node.next != nil

```
code to loop through the linked list until the next value is nil, representing the end of the linked list. Under this code is where the logic of each function is implemented. There is a small example linked list in the bottom of the code which creates and prints a linked list.
